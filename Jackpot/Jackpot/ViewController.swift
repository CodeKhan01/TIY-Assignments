/* 1. Delete ViewController, and create a "Table View Controller" as the main interface so that the user can see.
    2. Create a Navigation Controller that will handle the user view transitions.
    3. Add a "button" from the object library and name it "add".
    4. When you click the "add button", make it generate a random number between 1-53.
    5. Once it generates 6 random numbers, place it in a cell in the Table View Controller that we created earlier.
    5. Work on Essay and create a pull request.
